                        Argon is an open-source javascript library and web browser
                        developed my Georgia Tech's Augmented Enviornments Lab. 
                        Argon allows for the creation of augmented reality web 
                        pages and integrates a variety of other libraries and tools,
                        such as Aframe, Vuforia, and Twine. More information

                        City fables is a project we worked on for a year in collaboration
                        with Malmo University. We worked to create an AR experience
                        that took historical footage, images, and audio and created an 
                        interactive museum piece. Visitors could open the website and look at
                        images on the wall through their phone which would trigger various
                        media files to appear.

                    <p class="info">
                        In working on the project we learned how to use Aframe, 
                        Vuforia, and Twine, as well as gained HTML and JavaScript
                        coding experience. We also thought a lot about how users 
                        can interact with AR apps and webpages, developing a number
                        of different solutions. One solution was to use a reticle,
                        which meant users never actually had to touch their phone
                        screen and simply had to move their phone about to interact 
                        with the app.

                        We are working on a new project, currently
                        dubbed "The Table". It is a multi-user, kind of social media
                        tool, that allows users to add and edit 3d objects to real world 
                        scenes, either in the form of panoramas from google maps 
                        or the live camera feed.
