                        Programming games for the Game Boy is a particular challege 
                        that was tackled in CS 2261, Media Device Architecture. 
                        It was a fun challenge working with a very specific piece 
                        of hardware. There is less space on a game boy than on a 
                        computer, and for art there are far fewer pixels to work 
                        with. In coding all the way down to turning on and off 
                        single pixels and getting button inputs we were able to 
                        learn about how these sort of devices worked, on top of 
                        learning more about good game design.
