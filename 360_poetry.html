                        The art of creating and telling stories in a 360 degree, 
                        augmented or virtual reality enviornment is still quite 
                        new. Artists, filmmakers, and game designers are still 
                        just figuring it all out. There's a subtle balance to be
                         had between utilizing the full space while also not 
                         loosing the viewer, directing the eye while also giving
                         freedom to explore a new world.

                        I was fascinated with the idea of using this new medium
                        to display a poem, much like a lyric video. Working in 
                        Blender I modeled a world in which Allen Ginsberg's A 
                        Supermarket in California can come to life. I added text
                        and animations and tested a variety of different versions
                        on both on other students as well as adults less familiar
                        with 360 videos.

                        There were certain aspects of the final project that 
                        worked quite well, such as the overall enviornment and
                        placing the text within the world, and others that require
                        more experimentation and improvement. I chose to heavily
                        direct the viewers gaze, rather than giving them the 
                        freedom of looking throughout the scene wherever they 
                        pleased. For some this seemed to work quite well, while 
                        others preferrred to ignore the poem entirely and simply
                        look around. Overall though, this was a productive and 
                        moderatley successful introduction to a fascinating new field.
