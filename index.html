    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">City Fables</h3>
    <p>In collaboration with colleagues from Malmö University in Malmö Sweden, Georgia Tech's 
    Augmented Environments helped to develop a mixed-reality experience that is a narrative of cultural 
    moments from the first half of the twentieth century. The Swedish project, under the 
    direction of Profs. Maria Engerberg and Per Linde, is called Stadsfabula. The AEL 
    helped to create and test an Argon application that recognizes historic photographs
    on the walls of a museum space and plays the video and audio content. This is an experiment in 
    the use of the Argon-aframe platform to create a compelling multimedia experience that 
    is also easy to program and to modify. </p>

    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Invisible Cities</h3>
    <p>Invisible Cities is a mobile dashboard for collaboratively developing AR monuments 
    and expansive artworks in public squares. Users are able to create, share, and maintain
    public AR works that can be shared with a small community or the entire city. Users can
    engage in creating a socially engaged AR with their fellow citizens. In an age of 
    post-truth and fake news, AR public monuments serve as a touchstone for cultural 
    heritage and expression. Affording communities the ability to develop AR worlds that 
    reflect their sentiments, is a key aspect of this project. The research does take a cue 
    from Italo Calvino's wonderful book, Invisible Cities.</p>
    
    <p>Invisible Cities started as a project using Georgia Tech's Augmented Environments Lab's 
    augmented reality browser, Argon. The project was developed around that particular platform, and 
    from there a desktop version using Google Maps rather than actual live camera feed was developed.</p><p>

    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Bill's Excellent Adventure</h3>
    <p>One of the most interesting classes at Georgia Tech is CS 2261, Media Device Architecture, in
    which students learn to make games for the GameBoy Advance. It was a fun challenge working with such 
    a specific piece of hardware. There are a number of limitations working with a GameBoy that one
    doesn't come across designing a game for a modern computer. There is far less storage space,
    and far less screen real estate to work with. Designers are forced to come up with creative solutions
    for both coding and art problems. We were able to learn about how these sort of devices worked by
    learning to code very simple processes, such as turning on and off single pixels and getting button input.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Over the course of the semester I created a number of different games, such as modified versions of 
      Space Invaders and Vanguard, but it was all leading up to one final game. Bill's Excellent Adventure is
      a cute silly little game about an overworked CS professor who finally gets to sleep only to find himself 
      trapped in a dream version of his classroom and forced to run around fixing various pieces of classroom 
      equipment in little minigames.</p>
      <p>
      One such minigame is a platforming challene where the screen is split into
      4 different colored columns, white, cyan, yellow, and magenta, and there are a series of white, cyan, yellow,
      and magenta platforms. When a platform is in the column of its color it cannot be jumped on. For example, if
      a yellow platform is in the yellow column the player cannot see it or jump on it. The player may swap the column
      colors to reveal new platforms, but at the risk of the platform they are on disapearing. Its a simple little
      game with a goal of simply reaching the top of the map, but proved fun to play and let me learn how to tweak
      game mechanics to make something that not only works but is satisfying.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game may be played by downloading the gameboy emulator, virtual boy advanced, and the game itself.

    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Chain Reaction</h3>
    <p>Processing is a software sketchbook and language for computer graphics. It is used in many Georgia Tech computer 
    graphics classes, including Intro to Computational Media, Constructing the Movie Image, and Computer Graphics. While
    I have created a number of processing projects both for class and outside of class, the project I'm most proud of is 
    Chain Reaction. It is a puzzle game that requires players to place gears and chains of various sizes on a peg board 
    to go from one spinning gear to one or several stationary ones. The twist is that the game is played by two players, 
    each of whom can only see their half of the available pieces and the board. The players aren't allowed to talk to each 
    other and must figure out how to solve the puzzles simply by working together. This was one of the first big projects 
    I have done in Processing and I therefore learned a great deal about using the software, as well as about designing and 
    creating a fun playable game.

VG Dev is a club in the Georgia Tech Collge of Computing. Each semester teams develope a demo a handful of entirely student 
created games, everything from the coding and art to level design, music, and story creation. I have been a member of VG Dev since
my freshman year and have recently taken a leadership position in the club as the PR person. I've had the oportunity to work on a 
number of great games over the years. All the games that I've worked on, as well as many other great student creations can be found
at the VG Dev website.</p>
