                        Processing is a software sketchbook and language for computer graphics.
                        It is used in many Georgia Tech computer graphics classes, 
                        including Intro to Computational Media, Constructing the 
                        Movie Image, and Computer Graphics.

                        I was first introduced to Processing in Intro to Computational 
                        Media. My first big project with the software is called
                        CompuArt, and is a little program that allows users to 
                        create some fun, visually pleasing artworks.

                        The Processing project I am probably most proud of is 
                        Chain Reaction. Its a puzzle game that requires players 
                        to place gears and chains of various sizes on a peg board 
                        to go from one spinning gear to one or several stationary 
                        ones. The twist is that the game is played by two
                        players, each of whom can only see their half of the available
                        pieces and the board. The players arent' allowed to talk to 
                        each other and must figure out how to solve the puzzles 
                        simply by working together. This is one of the first big
                        projects I had done in Processing and I therefore learned a great
                        deal about using the software, as well as about designing and creating
                        a fun playable game. It is also the first game I'd worked 
                        on where I was the primary programmer.

                        In constructing the Moving Image we learned about Visual 
                        Music and artists like Oskar Fischinger, Norman McLaren, 
                        and James Whitney and were tasked to create our own works of
                        visual music, in Processing, that worked with or without
                        the actual music playing.

                        Most recently in computer graphics we've made the jump from
                        the standard Java Processing to using Python. To learn this
                        we created simple fractal graphics programs.

                        To run these Processing Programs you'll need to download 
                        the zip file. Some include executables for Windows, but in 
                        order to see the actual code you'll still need to download 
                        Processing. <br>
