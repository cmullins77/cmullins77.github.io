                        VG Dev is a club in the Georgia Tech Collge of Computing.
                        Each semester teams develope a demo a handful of entirely
                        student created games, everything from the coding and art
                        to level design, music, and story creation.

                        I have been a part of VG Dev since freshman year and have
                        worked on a number of games, including: Card Ninjas, 
                        Edge of Infinity, Stroll Through Slipspace, Hellion Hills
                        Retirement Home, Space Haulers, Yeggquest, and most
                        recently Nova Quest. All of these games can be found on 
                        the VG Dev <a href="http://vgdev.gtorg.gatech.edu/games/">website</a>.

                        I also enjoy creating games outside of VG Dev using a variety 
                        of programs, such as Unity or Gamemaker. I also worked on 
                        a text based game, much like Zork, with a group. The game is 
                        titled Stop Dead in Your Tracks and was coded using Inform.
                        You can play it by downloading this <a href="assets/files/output.gblorb"> file</a>.

                        Programming games for the Game Boy is a particular challege 
                        that was tackled in CS 2261, Media Device Architecture. 
                        It was a fun challenge working with a very specific piece 
                        of hardware. There is less space on a game boy than on a 
                        computer, and for art there are far fewer pixels to work 
                        with. In coding all the way down to turning on and off 
                        single pixels and getting button inputs we were able to 
                        learn about how these sort of devices worked, on top of 
                        learning more about good game design.
